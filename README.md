<h2>About me:</h2>

I am an enthusiast of technology, programming and bass player in the free times, you can find some covers in my page on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/crissilva_l?igshid=ZGUzMzM3NWJiOQ==">@crissilva_l</a>. Don't worry if you come across a closed profile, that's why I'm a reserved person when we are talking about my personal life, but you're welcome to send an invite.

<h2>What I've learned so far</h2>

Today the main tools I use are part of the Microsoft stack, such as excel, power query, power bi and power automate. Still in the analysis part, I use the pandas and python framework a lot to generate reports. As a developer, I've been using python and Qt, C# and .Net, Ionic, Angular and building rest API's with NestJs and Typescript. I have knowledge about SQL and relational databases, mainly PostgresSQL.

<h2>What I'm looking for</h2>

I started my studies in data science and software engineering in addition to expanding my knowledge, seeking a position within the technology area with a focus on data science.
