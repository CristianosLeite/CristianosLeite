<h2>About me:</h2>

I am an enthusiast of technology, programming and bass player in the free times, you can find some covers in my page on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/crissilva_l?igshid=ZGUzMzM3NWJiOQ==">@crissilva_l</a>. Don't worry if you come across a closed profile, that's why I'm a reserved person when we are talking about my personal life, but you're welcome to send an invite. Currently, I work with administration and manage a company in the city where I live.

<h2>How do I get here?</h2>

Well, I didn't parachute (not at all). My professional history began early, at the age of 14. Son of a single mother, black and without many opportunities. I can't complain about anything, because I'm here today to write this text about myself and, thanks to her, with a minimum of culture and education. Why not more? Because I didn't really take my studies seriously while I could. But I don't regret it, the opposite. Being an introverted person, this painful process was super important in my life and in building my professional persona, which helps me deal with clients even today. I started working as a construction assistant, I worked for a year until I started working as a gardener, where I got to meet people that I am grateful to this day. I was recommended to work at a construction materials company as an apprentice and I stayed there until I was nominated to work at another company in the same segment. I did a little bit of everything, but the main thing was replacing goods and organizing stock. I always had a good relationship with my bosses for all the companies I worked for, which allowed me to return to the previous company, now as a storekeeper. I remained in that position for three years, until I could no longer deal with the pressure of responsibility that I had to assume, combined with psychological problems (depression). My former employers are wonderful people and have tried very hard to help me during this period, but what I really needed was some time for myself. For a year I worked as a computer technician, from home, providing maintenance on computers. I've always been interested in technology, but I never knew how to support myself. Then came the opportunity to work as a receptionist at a driving school. As I've always enjoyed dealing with customers, the opportunity came in handy, plus it was a totally different environment. I worked for a year as an attendant. Then several opportunities arose within the company and I went through all sectors. I was always praised by my former manager, for whom I have a very special affection until today. My boss always saw me as a person he could count on in any situation, until this day. Not only that, he always had a lot of confidence in me and my work. The last sector I stayed in was the administrative one, where I was able to learn a lot related to the accounting part of the company in addition to the management part that I was always taught during the entire period in which I was exercising the function. My position as manager was assigned by my own manager, who until then remained working at the company for a period, but as a theoretical instructor.

<h2>And why change?</h2>

Although I now work for an amazing company, I always felt that it's still not my area, so I continue to study a lot. At the front of the company, I was able to change a lot of things, starting with the automation of some routines and the implementation of other tools that helped in the process. As a result, I was able to learn a little about several technologies that I have been trying to improve myself with.

<h2>What I've learned so far</h2>

Today the main tools I use are part of the Microsoft stack, such as excel, power query, power bi and power automate. Still in the analysis part, I use the pandas and python framework a lot to generate reports. As a developer, I've already made some applications using python and Qt, C# and .Net, Ionic, Angular and building rest API's with NestJs and Typescript. I have knowledge about SQL and relational databases, mainly PostgresSQL. I haven't yet developed any application that uses a database noSQL or newSQL, but I have a base of theoretical knowledge about each type of database and use cases.

<h2>What I'm looking for</h2>

I started my studies in data science and software engineering in addition to expanding my knowledge, seeking a position within the technology area with a focus on data science.
